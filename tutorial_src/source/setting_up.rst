Getting Started
***************

Installing & Setting up Casbah
==============================

You should have `MongoDB <http://mongodb.org>`_ setup  and running on your machine (these docs assume you are running on *localhost* on the default port of *27017*) before proceeding. If you need help setting up MongoDB please see `the MongoDB quickstart install documentation <http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Quickstart>`_.

To start with, you need to either download the latest Casbah driver and place it in your classpath, or set it up in the dependency manager/build tool of your choice (The authors highly recommend the Scala `simple-build-tool <http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/>`_ - it makes Scala development easy).

Setting up without a Dependency/Build Manager (Source + Binary)
----------------------------------------------------------------

The latest build as of |today| is |release|, cross-built for both Scala 2.8.0 (final) and Scala 2.8.1 (final). 

The builds are published to the `Scala-tools.org <http://scala-tools.org>`_ Maven repositories and should be easily available to add to an existing Scala project.

You can always get the latest source for Casbah from `the github repository <https://github.com/mongodb/casbah>`_::

    $ git clone git://github.com/mongodb/casbah

*PLEASE NOTE*: As of the 2.0 release, Casbah has been broken into
 several modules which can be used to strip down which features you need.  For example, you can use the Query DSL independent of the GridFS implementation if you wish. The following dependency manager information uses the master artifact which downloads and uses *all* of Casbah's modules by default.
 
Using Dependency/Build Managers
-------------------------------

First, you should add the package repository to your Dependency/Build Manager. Our releases & snapshots are currently hosted at::

   http://scala-tools.org/repo-releases/ /* For Releases */
   http://scala-tools.org/repo-snapshots/ /* For snapshots */

Set both of these repositories up in the appropriate manner - they contain Casbah as well as any specific dependencies you may require. (SBT users note that Scala-Tools is builtin to SBT as most Scala projects publish there)


Setting Up Maven
-----------------
You can add Casbah to Maven with the following dependency block. 

Scala 2.8.0 users::

        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.mongodb.casbah</groupId>
            <artifactId>casbah_2.8.0</artifactId>                           
            <version>2.1.5.0</version>
            <type>pom</type>
        <dependency>

Scala 2.8.1 users::

        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.mongodb.casbah</groupId>
            <artifactId>casbah_2.8.1</artifactId>                           
            <version>2.1.5.0</version>
            <type>pom</type>
        <dependency>

Scala 2.9.0.1 users (Scala 2.9.0.1 contains `critical fixes against 2.9.0.final <http://www.scala-lang.org/node/9708>`; do not use 2.9.0.final)::

        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.mongodb.casbah</groupId>
            <artifactId>casbah_2.9.0-1</artifactId>                           
            <version>2.1.5.0</version>
            <type>pom</type>
        <dependency>


Scala 2.9.1 users::

        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.mongodb.casbah</groupId>
            <artifactId>casbah_2.9.1</artifactId>                           
            <version>2.1.5-1</version>
            <type>pom</type>
        <dependency>

        

Setting Up Ivy (w/ Ant)
-----------------------
You can add Casbah to Ivy with the following dependency block.

Scala 2.8.0 users::

        <dependency org="com.mongodb.casbah" name="casbah_2.8.0" rev="2.1.5.0"/>

Scala 2.8.1 users::

        <dependency org="com.mongodb.casbah" name="casbah_2.8.1" rev="2.1.5.0"/>
        
Scala 2.9.0.1 users (Scala 2.9.0.1 contains `critical fixes against 2.9.0.final <http://www.scala-lang.org/node/9708>`; do not use 2.9.0.final)::

        <dependency org="com.mongodb.casbah" name="casbah_2.9.0-1" rev="2.1.5.0"/>

Setting up SBT 
---------------
Finally, you can add Casbah to SBT by adding the following to your project file::

    val casbah = "com.mongodb.casbah" %% "casbah" % "2.1.5.0"

The double percentages (`%%`) is not a typo---it tells SBT that the library is crossbuilt and to find the appropriate version for your project's Scala version. If you prefer to be explicit you can use this instead::
    
    // Scala 2.8.0
    val casbah = "com.mongodb.casbah" % "casbah_2.8.0" % "2.1.5.0"
    // Scala 2.8.1
    val casbah = "com.mongodb.casbah" % "casbah_2.8.1" % "2.1.5.0"
    // Scala 2.9.0.1 (don't use Scala 2.9.0.final; 2.9.0.1 contains critical fixes)
    val casbah = "com.mongodb.casbah" % "casbah_2.9.0-1" % "2.1.5.0"

Don't forget to reload the project and run ``sbt update`` afterwards to download the dependencies (SBT doesn't check every build like Maven).

Migrating to Casbah 2.x from Casbah 1.x
========================================

If you used Casbah before, and are looking to migrate from Casbah 1.x to Casbah 2.x
there are some things which have changed and you should be aware of to effectively update your code.

Base Package Name 
------------------
For starters, the base package has changed.  The now abandoned 1.1.x branch which 
became 2.0 was already doing a package change, and with 2.0 Casbah has become a
supported MongoDB project. As a result, Casbah's package has changed for the 2.0 
release and you will need to update your code accordingly:

===========================  ===============================  =====================
Casbah 1.0.x                  Casbah 1.1.x (never released)    Casbah 2.0
===========================  ===============================  =====================
 com.novus.casbah.mongodb      com.novus.casbah                 com.mongodb.casbah
===========================  ===============================  =====================

.. _casbah-modules:

Removed Features
----------------
A number of features existed in Casbah as artifacts of early prototyping.  They were buggy, poorly tested and because of their nature often introduced weird problems for users.

As a result, they have been removed now that replacement versions of their functionality exist.

Removal of Implicit Tuple -> DBObject Conversions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Previously, it was possible with Casbah to cast Tuples to :dochub:`DBObject`::
    
    val x: DBObject = ("foo" -> "bar", "x" -> 5, "y" -> 238.1)

This feature was provided by implicit conversions which attempt to target `Product` which is the base class of all Tuples.  Unfortunately, this functionality was often unreliable and targeted the wrong things for conversion (Such as instances of `Option[_]`).  After a lot of evaluation and attempts to create a better approach a decision was made to remove this feature.  Casbah 2.0 includes wrappers for :dochub:`DBObject` which follow Scala 2.8's Collection interfaces including Scala compatible builders and constructors.  As such, the same previous syntax is possible by passing the Tuple pairs to `MongoDBObject.apply`::

    val x: DBObject = MongoDBObject("foo" -> "bar", "x" -> 5, "y" -> 238.1)
    /* x: com.mongodb.casbah.Imports.DBObject = { "foo" : "bar" , "x" : 5 , "y" : 238.1} */
    val y = MongoDBObject("foo" -> "bar", "x" -> 5, "y" -> 238.1)          
    /* y: com.mongodb.casbah.commons.Imports.DBObject = { "foo" : "bar" , "x" : 5 , "y" : 238.1} */

We also provide a builder pattern which follows Scala 2.8's Map Builder::

    val b = MongoDBObject.newBuilder
    /* b: com.mongodb.casbah.commons.MongoDBObjectBuilder = com.mongodb.casbah.commons.MongoDBObjectBuilder@113f25e3 */
    b += "x" -> 5
    b += "y" -> 238.1
    b += "foo" -> "bar"
    val x: DBObject = b.result
    /* x: com.mongodb.casbah.commons.Imports.DBObject = { "x" : 5 , "y" : 238.1 , "foo" : "bar"} */

Finally, any Scala map can still be cast to a DBObject without issue::

    val x: DBObject = Map("foo" -> "bar", "x" -> 5, "y" -> 238.1)
    /* x: com.mongodb.casbah.Imports.DBObject = { "foo" : "bar" , "x" : 5 , "y" : 238.1} */

It is *still* possible to use Tuples in the :ref:`Query DSL <casbah-query>` however, as there is less need for broad implicit conversions to accomplish that functionality.

`batchSafely` Removed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Casbah 1.1.x introduced a `batchSafely` command which used the Java Driver's `requestStart()`, `requestDone()` and `getPrevErrors()` functions.  MongoDB is deprecating the use of `getPrevErrors()` and as such, Casbah has removed the functionality in anticipation of that feature going away in a near future release.

New Features
-------------

Query DSL Operators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Casbah previously lagged behind the official MongoDB server in supported :ref:`Query DSL <casbah-query>` `$ Operators`.  As of 2.0, all `$ Operators` currently documented as supported in MongoDB are provided.  A list of some of the new operators added in 2.0 include:

    * :dochub:`$slice`
    * :dochub:`$or`
    * :dochub:`$not`
    * :dochub:`$each` (*special operator only supported nested inside :dochub:`$addToSet`*)
    * :dochub:`$type` (*Uses type arguments and class manifests to allow a nice fluid Scala syntax*)
    * :dochub:`$elemMatch`
    * Array Operators
    * All GeoSpatial Operators including :dochub:`$near` and :dochub:`$within`

Further, the DSL system has been completely overhauled.  As part of adding test coverage a number of edge cases were discovered with the DSL that caused inconsistent behavior.  The majority of the Query DSL should continue to work the same, but we have started moving to the use of Type Classes and Context Boundaries to limit what a valid input to any given operator is (2.1 will include expanded use of these merged with custom serializers).  

New syntax for $not
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to fix a number of bugs and readability issues with the :dochub:`$not` operator, it has been modified.

Previously, the correct syntax for using :dochub:`$not` was::

    "foo".$not $gte 15 $lt 35.2 $ne 16
    
With Casbah 2.0, this syntax has been modified to be more clear to both the developer *and* the compiler::

    "foo" $not { _ $gte 15 $lt 35.2 $ne 16 }
    
The same syntax is supported for the special version of :dochub:`$pull` which allows for nested operator tests.

General Code Cleanup
--------------------

There has been a lot of general code cleanup in this release and while many features appear the same externally they may have been refactored. 

Casbah Modules
---------------
While Casbah has a large stable of features, some users (such as those using a framework like Lift which already provides MongoDB wrappers) wanted access to certain parts of Casbah without importing the whole system.  As a result, Casbah has been broken out into several modules which make it easier to pick and choose the features you want.

If you use the individual modules you'll need to use the import statement from each of these.  If you use the import statement from the `casbah-core` module, everything except GridFS will be imported (not everyone uses GridFS so we don't load it into memory & scope unless it is needed).  The module names can be used to select which dependencies you want from maven/ivy/sbt, as we publish individual artifacts.  If you import just `casbah`, this is a master pom which includes the whole system and can be used just like 1.1.x was (that is to say, you can pretend the module system doesn't exist more or less).


This is the breakdown of dependencies and packages for the new system:

We cover the import of each module in their appropriate tutorials, but each module has its own `Imports` object which loads all of its necessary code.  By way of example both of these statements would import the Query DSL::

    // Imports core, which grabs everything including Query DSL
    import com.mongodb.casbah.Imports._ 
    // Imports just the Query DSL along with Commons and its dependencies
    import com.mongodb.casbah.query.Imports._
    
    
The full set of changes between 1.0.x and 2.x:


2\.1\.5\.0 / 2011-05-26 
==================
  * [2\.9.0 only] Adjusted dynamic settings to build against 2.9.0-1 and Casbah 2.1.5.0
  * [2\.9\.0 only] Prototype "Dynamic" module (You must enable Scala's support for Dynamic)
  * [2\.9\.0 only] I seem to have missed project files for SBT and casbah-dynamic
  * [2\.9\.0 only] Tweaks and adjustments to get this building and testing solidly on 2\.9\.0-1
  * Disabled a few tests that weren't passing and known to be 'buggy' in specs1\.  These are fixed for the upcoming 2\.2\.0 release on specs2; they are test bugs rather than Casbah bugs\.
  * RegEx $not was just flat out wrong - was producing {"foo": {"foo": /<regex>/}} instead of {"foo": {"$not": {/<regex>/}}
  * Added a getAsOrElse method

2\.1\.2 / 2011-04-09 
==================

  * SCALA-28 Updated Java Driver to Release 2\.5\.3
    + JAVA-315 several exception cases do not put back the dbport in pool, resulting in forever hanging pool to that server
    + JAVA-312 Added UUID support to JSON Serialization
    + JAVA-318 Fixed JMX issues for similar ServerAddresses
  * SCALA-27 Properly Serialize Option[T] so that None is null and Some expands out
  * SCALA-26: findOneByID(id) and findOneById(id, fields) had different casing; when findOneById(id, fields) was called as byID an implicit caused the single arg version to be called instead, yielding unexpected results.

2\.1\.1 / 2011-03-29
==================

  * SCALA-25 Added support for $bit operator, with and and or options
  * Updated to Java Driver 2\.5\.2 (Bugfixes)
    + JAVA-301 - Replicaset w/ auth warnings too verbose when not authd against local/admin db
    + JAVA-304 - Problem with closing cursors - killCursors
  

2\.1\.0 / 2011-03-15 
==================

  * SCALA-22 Added a dropTarget boolean option to rename collection, which specifies behavior if named target collection already exists, proxies JAVA-238
  * Removed resetIndexCache, which has also been removed from the Java Driver
  * SCALA-21 Added "set metadata" method to match Java Driver (See Java-261)
  * SCALA-20 Updated to Java Driver 2.5
    + See Release Notes: http://groups.google.com/group/mongodb-user/browse_thread/thread/a693ad4fdf9c3731/931f46f7213b6775?show_docid=931f46f7213b6775
  * SCALA-21 - Update GridFS to use DBObject views.  Holding back full bugfix until we have a 2.5 build to link against
  * Example adjustments to filter by start time and namespace
  * SCALA-10 - And this is why we unit test.  Size was returning empty for cursor based results as it wasn't pulling the right value.  Fixed, calling cursor.size.
  * Added an alternative object construction method for MongoDBObject with a list of pairs, rather than varargs [philwills]
  * Making scaladoc for MongoURI more explicit. Note that the wiki markup for lists isn't actually implemented in scaladoc yet. [philwills]
  * Refactor Collection and Cursors using Abstract types, explicit 'DBObject' version is always returned from DB, Collection etc now. Those wanting to use typed versions must code the flip around by hand. !!! BREAKING CHANGE, SEE CODE / EXAMPLES 
  * SCALA-10 Updated MapReduce interfaces to finish 1.8 compatibility     
    + Renamed MapReduceError to MapReduceException; MapReduceError is a non exception which represents a failed job     
    + Changed MapReduceResult to automatically proxy 'results' in inline       result sets
  * Added missing methods to GridFSDBFile necessary to access the underlying datastream
  * Fixed setter/getter of option on cursor
  * For several reasons changed backing trait of DBList PML from Buffer to LinearSeq
  * Moved to new MapReduce functionality based on MongoDB 1.7.4+ !!! You must now specify an output mode.
    + See http://blog.evilmonkeylabs.com/2011/01/27/MongoDB-1_8-MapReduce/
  * MapReduce failures shouldn't throw Error which can crash the runtime
  * New MapReduceSpec updates to include tests against new MongoDB MapReduce logic

2\.0\.2 / 2011-01-25 
==================

  * Fixed the MongoDBOBject 'as' operator to return the proper type, instead of Any. (philwills)

Casbah 2\.0\.1 / 2011-01-04 
==================

  * SCALA-16: Added a few additional  validation tests against getAs and as on MongoDBObject
  * SCALA-17 - Fixed syntax of $within and its nested operators, unit test passes



2\.0 / 2011-01-03 
=========================

Notable Changes since Casbah 1.0.8.1:

* Ownership Change: Casbah is now an officially supported MongoDB Driver 
    * All bugs should be reported at http://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SCALA
    * Package Change: Casbah is now `com.mongodb.casbah` (See migration guide)
    * Documentation (ScalaDocs, Migration Guide & Tutorial) is available at http://api.mongodb.org/scala/casbah
* Casbah is now broken into several submodules - see http://api.mongodb.org/scala/casbah/migrating.html
* Casbah releases are now published to http://scala-tools.org
* SBT Build now publishes -sources and -javadoc artifacts
* Added heavy test coverage
* ++ additivity operator on MongoDBObject for lists of tuple pairs
* Updates to Java Driver wrappings
    * Casbah now wraps Java Driver 2.4 and fully supports all options & interfaces including Replica Set and Write Concern support
    * added a WriteConcern helper object for Scala users w/ named & default args
    * added findAndModify / findAndRemove
* Stripped out support for implicit Product/Tuple conversions as they're buggy as hell and constantly interfere with other code.
* Migrated Conversions code from core to commons, repackaging as com.mongodb.casbah.commons.conversions
    * Moved loading of ConversionHelpers from Connection creation to instantiation of Commons' Implicits (This means conversions are ALWAYS loaded now for everyone)
* Switched off of configgy to slf4j as akka did
    * Added SLF4J-JCL Bindings as a +test* dependency (so we can print logging while testing without forcing you to use an slf4j implementation yourself)
    * Moved Logger from core to commons
* Massive improvements to Query DSL:
    * Added new implementations of $in, $nin, $all and $mod with tests. $mod now accepts non-Int numerics and aof two differing types.
    * Full test coverage on DSL (and heavy coverage on other modules)
    * Migrated $each to a now functioning internal hook on $addToSet only exposed in certain circumstances
    * Various cleanups to Type constraints in Query DSL
    * Full support for all documented MongoDB query operators
    * Added new $not syntax, along with identical support for nested queries in $pull
    * Valid Date and Numeric Type boundaries introduced and used instead of Numeric (since Char doesn't actually workwith Mongo and you can't double up type bounds)
    * Added full support for geospatial query.
    * Resolved an issue where the $or wasn't being broken into individual documents as expected. 
    * DSL Operators now return DBObjects rather than Product/Tuple (massive fixes to compatibility and performance result)
    * Added @see linkage to each core operator's doc page
* GridFS Changes:
    * GridFS' `files' now returned a MongoCursor not a raw Java DBCursor
    * GridFS findOne now returns an Option[_] and detects nulls like Collection
* Added "safely" resource loaning methods on Collection & DB     
    * Given an operation, uses write concern / durability on a single connection and throws an exception if anything goes wrong.
* Culled casbah-mapper.  Mapper now lives as an independent project at http://github.com/maxaf/casbah-mapper
* Bumped version of scala-time to the 0.2 release
* Added DBList support via MongoDBList, following 2.8 collections

* Adjusted boundaries on getAs and expand; the view-permitting Any was causing ambiguity issues at runtime with non AnyRefs (e.g. AnyVal). 
* Fixed an assumption in expand which could cause runtime failure 
  * Updated MongoDBObject factory & builder to explicitly return a type; some pieces were assuming at runtime that it was a MongoDBObjectBuilder$anon1 which was FUBAR
