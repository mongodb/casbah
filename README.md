Reporting Bugs

Please report all issues on the [MongoDB Jira Scala project][jira]

We also maintain a  [Casbah Mailing List][mongodb-casbah-users] on Google Groups, where you can address questions and problems.

Notice for users of old, Pre-2.0 versions of Casbah
---------------------------------------------------

The package has changed as of version 2.0 to `com.mongodb.casbah`; version 1.1 of Casbah used the package `com.novus.casbah` and versions 1.0 and below were packaged as `com.novus.casbah.mongodb`. 

In addition, we have broken the project out into several artifacts:
  
  * `casbah-commons` - Provides utilities to improve working with Scala and MongoDB together without dependencies on anything but the MongoDB Java Driver and ScalaJ-Collection.  This includes Scala Collections 2.8 compatible wrappers for DBList and DBObject as well as type conversion facilities to simplify the use of Scala types with MongoDB (and register your own custom types)
  * `casbah-query` - The Query DSL which provides an internal Scala DSL for querying MongoDB using native, MongoDB syntax operators.  This only depends upon Commons and can be used standalone without the rest of Casbah.
  * `casbah-core` - This is the wrappers for interacting directly with MongoDB providing more Scala-like interactions.  It depends upon both Commons and Query as well as ScalaTime for use of JodaTime (which we prefer over JDK date but you are welcome to use JDK Dates).
  * `casbah-gridfs` - This provides enhancement wrappers to GridFS including loan pattern support.  It is dependent on Core (and by transitive property, Commons & Query as well) but is not included in Core - you must explicitly load if it you want to use GridFS.

About
-----
Casbah is an interface for [MongoDB][MongoDB] designed to provide more flexible access from both Java and Scala.  While the current core focus is on providing a Scala oriented wrapper interface around the Java mongo driver, support for other JVM languages may come in the future.

For the Scala side, contains series of wrappers and DSL-like functionality for utilizing MongoDB from within Scala. This currently utilises the very Java-oriented Mongo Java driver, and attempts to provide more scala-like functionality on top of it. This has been tested with MongoDB 1.2.x+ and v2.x of the Mongo java driver.

We are constantly adding new functionality, and maintain a detailed [Tutorial][Tutorial].

Please address any questions or problems to the [Casbah Mailing List][mongodb-casbah-users] on Google Groups.
