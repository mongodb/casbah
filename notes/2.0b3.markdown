2.0b3 / 2010-12-08 
==================

  * Added heavy test coverage
  * Tests/demos of all additivity of DBObject and Tuple
  * ++ additivity operator on MongoDBObject for lists of tuple pairs
  * Added test for $nor demonstrating additivity between a DSLed DBObject and a tuple
  * Added val aliasing for MongoDBObject -> DBObject and MongoDBList -> DBList (only for the 'object' singletons)
  * Added bareword DSL operator for $nor
  * Added new $not syntax, along with identical support for nested queries in $pull:
  * Added sbt-growl-plugin for testing results notification
  * Added SLF4J-JCL Bindings as a *test* dependency (so we can print logging while testing without forcing you to use an slf4j implementation yourself)
  * $elemMatch shouldn't have been a nestable, and only accept DBObject. Fixed.
  * Full test coverage on DSL ...nested query chains are heavily broken at the moment.
  * Migrated $each to a now functioning internal hook on $addToSet only exposed in certain circumstances
  * Various cleanups to docs and type constraints in BarewordOperators
  * Changed Geo related stuff to use ValidNumericType instead of Numeric as some Numerics are not valid, and we'll be using Valid*Type for auto conversion reg soon
  * Upgraded Specs to 1.6.6 against 2.8.1. Closes #28
  * GridFS' `files' should have returned a MongoCursor not a raw Java DBCursor.  Closes #25
  * Replaced optWrap call removed accidentally from findAndModify
  * GridFS findOne wasn't returning Option[_] and detecting nulls like Collection, which has been corrected.  Closes #26
  * Removed FluidMongoSyntaxSpec from old tests, now migrated to DSL Specs
  * Added a false $eq operator to emulate key = value easily in the DSL
  * Restored ability to chain DSL operators (First pass - may change)
  * Base tests for Core Operators
  * Fixed RegEx and Binary $type tests
  * Differentiated GeoCoords to use two different Manifested Numerics for differing datatypes
  * Timestamp must take precedence over date to match properly
  * Changed precedence so DBList is first as it's also a dbobject and test failed
  * Added Joda DateTime to Type testing in $type
  * Updates and test coverage for $size and $exists
  * Added new implementations of $in, $nin, $all and $mod with tests. $mod now accepts non-Int numerics and of two differing types.
  * Stripped out support for implicit Product/Tuple conversions as they're buggy as hell and constantly interfere with other code.
  * Implemented new code and tests for $gt, $gte, $lt, $lte.
  * Added Date tests to $Ne and added testing for $lt
  * Valid Date and Numeric Type boundaries introduced and used instead of Numeric (since Char doesn't actually workwith Mongo and you can't double up type bounds)
  * Refactor of $ne to a new baseline, new unit test for DSLCoreOperators to test it
  * Checkpoint, ValidProduct won't work either
  * mid-refactor of core operators code, checkpoint for if we keep aritied tuple code
  * Removed crufty extra logging in distinctKeySet
  * Ported MapReduce test to Specs in new directory structure; needs more test methods
  * Removing GridFSSpec as it has been ported to Specs in the new modules
  * Changed sub$project names back to start with casbah- to reduce confusion with maven artifacts
  * Updated documentation buildout and migrated default build version to 2.8.1, removing 2.8.1rc4

2.0b2 / 2010-11-09 
==================
  
  * Added documentation build script
  * Moved loading of ConversionHelpers from Connection creation to instantiation of Commons' Implicits 
    - This means conversions are ALWAYS loaded now for everyone
  * Added registered conversion for Product (tuples) which fixes open issues with serialization
  * Migrated Conversions code from core to commons, repackaging as com.mongodb.casbah.commons.conversions   
    - Unit Test remains in Core as it uses core code to test loading/unloading which is fine for buildtime tests
  * Moved Logger from core to commons, package changed from com.mongodb.casbah.util.Logging to com.mongodb.casbah.commons.Logging

  * Fixes #17 added $rename and fixed a bug caused by $or implementation
  * References #4 , some scratch work towards creating a context bound
  * Fixes #1, added $each target and improved $addtoSet impl $each is a bit of an unfortunate stray in that it CAN be invoked elsewhere but should only work with $addToSet
  * Culled useless version javadoc cruft & added @seen to all bareword query ops
  * Fixes #3 Resolved an issue where the $or wasn't being broken into individual documents as expected.  Should be heavily tested.
  * Fixes #15, Wrap the return of operator calls in a DBObject constructor.
  * Fixed anchoring on CoreOperators - things like $mod and such needed to be callable
  * $mod was just flat out wrong - corrected.
  * Fixes #3 - Added $or operator with proper right-hand array creation.
  * Added @see linkage to each core operator's doc page
  * Fixes #10, added $slice operator
  * New Spec test for GridFS, ported from old tests and now using Mongo powered by logo
  * Removed 'batchSafely' methods as they are now deprecated and counterindicated
  * Renamed 'safely' methods to 'request' as they are NOT safe and 10gen convention is moving off 'safe' as a term.
  * Configuring output of SXR crosslinking
  * Added additional test for explicit and cast conversions of Maps to DBObject
  * Removed 'Package Bridge' and DeprecatedTypeAliases code.  Migration guide will be provided instead.
  * - moving 'bridge' code to a bridge package  which may or may not get   used
  * - Added SXR source builds
  * Changed publishing to Scala Tools... Obviously you need credentials there which are maintained outside the project

  * Updated README addressing start of move to MongoDB space
  * Migration of codebase for 10gen ownership   - Package changed from com.novus.* to com.mongodb.*     * Package aliases provided for bridging so you shouldn't need to migrate your 1.0 or 1.1-snapshot code forcibly right away   - Copyright updated to include 10gen   - Version changed from 1.1-SNAPSHOT to 2.0-SNAPSHOT     * Because of package change and modularisation 1.1 will be replaced with a 2.0 release

  * make them pay attention when enums aren't properly declared
  * added helpful fall-back conversions which are supposed to catch aped version of scala-time to the 0.2 release
  * publish POM-s
  * stop  "just make it happen" conversion
  * report malformed props that are claimed as enums
  * much saner publishing over SFTP
  * added support for Scala enums
  * type hints only carry through on non-iterable props; better unwrapping of parameterized types
  * added support for Set-s
  * improved fetching of type params; added more helpful error reporting
  * report location of MissingMapper exceptions
  * test
  * force-fed a very contrived example that better exercises polymorphic lists/maps
  * added a timing test case; fixed deserialization bug uncovered by accident during performance testing
  * HALF_UP rounding is required in the math context
  * - Forward port from 1.0.8.1 bugfix branch     * Factory & Builder for MongoDBObject always return as DBObject     * Unit test for reported issue
  * Merge branch 'master' of github.com:novus/casbah
  * added ability to specify strategy for turning non-string Map keys into strings
  * disabled parallelExecution because it confuses SSH key passphrase entry prompts while publishing
  * - Added "safely" and "batchSafely" resource loaning methods on Collection & DB     * Given an operation, uses write concern / durability on a single       connection and throws an exception if anything goes wrong.
  * - Adjusted boundaries on getAs and expand; the view-permitting Any was   causing ambiguity issues at runtime with non AnyRefs (e.g. AnyVal). - Fixed an assumption in expand which could cause runtime failure - Updated MongoDBObject factory & builder to explicitly return a type;   some pieces were assuming at runtime that it was a   MongoDBObjectBuilder$anon1 which fucked things up beyond all   recognition - New basic spec test for MongoDBObject, just validates expand behavior   ATM

  * protect Option fields from nulls
  * choose correct impl when writing to Map props
  * trace logging was causing NoSuchElementException-s on val-s
  * exposed propValue
  * will demand whaaambulance in case of missing mappers

  * Bridge package for the old package space - attempts to throw warnings  when people use the name while still allowing most of their code to  compile.
  * Functioning Specs port of the Conversions unit test, much better test now as well.
  * RichPropertyDescriptor#idProp is now an Option
  * Full module breakdown of Casbah.
  * keep Unix user name in rsync destination
