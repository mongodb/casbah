Casbah User Documentation
=========================

Welcome to the Casbah Documentation.  Casbah is a Scala toolkit for MongoDB ---
We use the term "toolkit" rather than "driver", as Casbah is a layer on top of
the official `mongo-java-driver <http://github.com/mongodb/mongo-java-driver>`_
for better integration with Scala.  This is as opposed to a native
implementation of the MongoDB wire protocol, which the Java driver does
exceptionally well. Rather than a complete rewrite, Casbah uses implicits, and
`Pimp My Library` code to enhance the existing Java code.
